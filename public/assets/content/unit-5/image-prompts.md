### أحمد يواجه مشاكل في مشروعه

```
Cinematic isometric 3D scene of a modern workspace. Ahmed, a 24-year-old Arab man in casual clothes, sits at his desk looking frustrated at multiple error messages floating as holographic red alerts around his computer screen. His project dashboard shows "SUCCESS: 70%" with warning indicators. Sarah, a 30-something Arab woman mentor wearing professional attire and a hijab, stands behind him with a knowing smile, holding a clipboard labeled "Debug Checklist". The atmosphere shows contrast between chaos (broken code symbols, red alerts) and order (Sarah's organized approach). Color palette: #050505 background, #FF6B35 for error alerts, #FFB800 for success indicators. Ultra-detailed, 8K quality, dramatic lighting.

### تصنيف أنواع الفشل

```
Cinematic isometric 3D visualization of a "Failure Classification System". A large holographic display shows 5 distinct failure categories as floating 3D icons: (1) Ambiguity - fog cloud, (2) Context - missing puzzle pieces, (3) Format - broken JSON brackets, (4) Hallucination - theatrical mask, (5) Edge Cases - warning boundaries. Ahmed points at the display while Sarah explains. Each category has Arabic labels. The scene suggests a scientific laboratory for prompt diagnosis. Color palette: #050505 background with #FF6B35 and #FFB800 accent lighting. Ultra-detailed, 8K quality.

### تقنية Self-Consistency

```
Cinematic isometric 3D scene showing the Self-Consistency technique. A central AI brain node generates 5 identical queries shown as glowing streams going to 5 different processing nodes. Each node returns an answer (4 show "23 ✓" in green, 1 shows "33 ✗" in red). Arrows converge to a "VOTE" podium that displays the winning answer. The concept of voting and consensus is clearly visualized. Ahmed watches in understanding while Sarah points to the voting mechanism. Citation floating: "Wang et al. 2022". Color palette: #050505, #FF6B35, #FFB800. Ultra-detailed, 8K quality, scientific visualization style.

### إطار ReAct للتصحيح

```
Cinematic isometric 3D visualization of the ReAct Framework. A circular workflow shows three connected stages: (1) THOUGHT - brain icon with Arabic "فكرة", (2) ACTION - gear/hand icon with Arabic "فعل", (3) OBSERVATION - eye icon with Arabic "ملاحظة". The cycle repeats 3 times getting smaller toward the center where a solution emerges. Ahmed and Sarah observe the cycle from the side. Floating citation: "Yao et al. 2022 - Princeton & Google". Color palette: #050505 background, #FF6B35 for action, #FFB800 for observation, white for thought. Ultra-detailed, 8K quality.

### Structured Outputs

```
Cinematic isometric 3D scene showing Structured Outputs concept. On the left: chaotic unstructured text floating randomly (labeled "90% success"). On the right: a perfect JSON structure with organized brackets, keys, and values glowing in formation (labeled "100% guaranteed"). In the center, a Schema Blueprint acts as a filter/mold transforming chaos into structure. Sarah demonstrates the transformation while Ahmed takes notes. The contrast between random vs. structured is emphasized. Color palette: #050505, #FF6B35 for unstructured, #FFB800 for structured. Ultra-detailed, 8K quality.

### Tree of Thoughts

```
Cinematic isometric 3D visualization of Tree of Thoughts technique. A literal glowing tree grows from a central problem node at the base. The tree branches into multiple pathways, each branch representing a different solution approach. Some branches have checkmarks (viable paths), others have X marks (dead ends). The best path glows brightest in gold leading to a star at the top. Three "expert" figures sit at different branches discussing. Citation floating: "Yao et al. 2023 - NeurIPS". Color palette: #050505 background, #FF6B35 for branches, #FFB800 for successful path. Ultra-detailed, 8K quality.

### Context Engineering

```
Cinematic isometric 3D scene showing Context Engineering as a control room. A large central display shows "CONTEXT BUDGET: 8000 tokens" with a pie chart divided into: System Prompt (20%), User Input (15%), Retrieved Data (35%), History (25%), Examples (5%). Sarah operates a mixing console with sliders for each component. Ahmed observes pie slices moving as she adjusts. The concept of budgeting and managing context is visualized as resource allocation. Floating year: "2025". Color palette: #050505 background, #FF6B35 and #FFB800 for chart segments. Ultra-detailed, 8K quality.

### Meta-Prompting

```
Cinematic isometric 3D recursive visualization of Meta-Prompting. A prompt document on a table generates a ghostly AI figure that analyzes and improves the same prompt, creating an enhanced version. This enhanced version then generates another AI that improves it again - showing 3 iterations with each version glowing brighter. A mirror effect emphasizes the self-improvement concept. Ahmed and Sarah watch the recursive process. Label: "Prompt → AI → Better Prompt → AI → Best Prompt". Color palette: #050505, #FF6B35, #FFB800 with increasing brightness. Ultra-detailed, 8K quality.

### Prompt Injection

```
Cinematic isometric 3D security scene showing Prompt Injection attack. A fortified AI castle/server receives legitimate green requests from the left. From the right, a red "trojan horse" request approaches carrying hidden malicious instructions (visualized as small red text inside). Warning symbols and shields appear. The concept shows the danger of trusting unvalidated input. A "System Prompt" vault inside the castle is the target. Sarah points out the threat while Ahmed looks concerned. Label: "OWASP LLM Top 10". Color palette: #050505, #FF6B35 for danger, #FFB800 for legitimate. Ultra-detailed, 8K quality.

## Image 10: unit-5/10.webp
### أحمد وسارة - إتمام الوحدة الخامسة

```
Cinematic isometric 3D celebration scene. Ahmed and Sarah stand together in a professional setting. Ahmed now has a confident posture, holding a certificate-like hologram showing "Quality Engineer" badge with 5 stars. Behind them, a dashboard displays: "Success Rate: 98%+", "Security: 5 Layers", "Production Ready ✓". All 16 badges from the unit float as golden achievement icons around them. Sarah gives a proud mentor's gesture. The scene conveys professional mastery and graduation to production-grade skills. Confetti and subtle celebration particles. Color palette: #050505, #FF6B35, #FFB800. Ultra-detailed, 8K quality.
